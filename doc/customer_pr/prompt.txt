I have a retail customer transaction dataset with these columns: InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, and Country.
The dataset is used for unsupervised customer segmentation. Apart from traditional RFM features (Recency, Frequency, Monetary),
what other feature engineering techniques can be applied to enhance the dataset?
Consider product diversity, purchasing patterns, temporal behavior, and geographical factors.
Also, please provide detailed steps to handle missing values, detect and treat duplicates, and calculate the RFM features properly.
Provide Python code following industry best practices including clear comments and modular functions
